# Recipe App

> The Recipe app keeps track of all the users' recipes and ingredients. It will allow the user to save ingredients, keep track of what they have, create recipes, and generate a shopping list based on what they have and what they are missing from a recipe. Also, since sharing recipes is an important part of cooking, the app should allow the user to make them public so anyone can access them.
